'Y'ii 'A'pplication 'A'lternative 'S'tructure - a skeleton Yii framework application directory structure based on what is used for the Yiiframework.com site itself and outlined in the wiki article: http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/155/the-directory-structure-of-the-yii-project-site

Directory Structure
-------------------
The main directory contains the following directories:

 - backend: a Yii Web application to hold non public-facing administrative functionality
 - frontend: the front-end Yii Web application - this represents your public-facing website
 - console: a Yii console application for your console and utility commands
 - common: a directory housing any code or configuration that is to be shared across two or more of the above applications

Please read: http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/155/the-directory-structure-of-the-yii-project-site for more information on the directory struture

Quick Start
===========
Download Yaas
-------------
And unpack to a local directory of your choosing

Install Yii
-----------
Then clone the latest read-only master branch of yii framework into common/lib/yii/ directory
$ cd common/lib
$ git clone https://github.com/yiisoft/yii.git yii

or you can download the desired version of the framework and move the contents of framework/ over to
common/lib/yii. When completed, ensure that common/lib/yii/framework/yii.php exists.

Deploy the development environment - I.E. Copy over environment specific files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cp -R backend/env/development/config/ backend/config/
$ cp -R backend/env/development/www/ backend/www/
$ cp -R frontend/env/development/config/ frontend/config/
$ cp -R frontend/env/development/www/ frontend/www/
$ cp -R console/env/development/config/ console/config/
$ cp -R console/env/development/yiic.php console/

Setup Web Document Roots
------------------------
Ensure that /frontend/www/ is an application webroot and /backend/www/ is also a webroot. These represent the frontend (public-facing) and backend (admin) applications. If using Apache web-server, one approach would be to setup vhosts that point to these directories as webroots.
E.G. 
local.yaas.com -> frontend/www/ 
and 
local.admin.yaas.com -> backend/www 
This way, if you visit http://local.yaas.com in your browser, it will run the index.php entry script at frontend/www/index.php. And similarly for the backend admin site.

One Other Quick Config Change
-----------------------------
Now that you have your frontend hostname setup, change the frontend.url setting in common/config/params-local.php to to match your setting
